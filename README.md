Project Title: Basic Python Expense Tracker

Project Overview:
The "Basic Python Expense Tracker" is a simple financial tool meant for users to track their everyday spending. With this program, users can add, store, and display their expenses, complete with descriptions and the respective amounts. While it's a slimmed-down version of a full-fledged expense manager, it provides a foundation that can be built upon for more advanced features.

Key Features:
1. Add Expenses: Users can drop in descriptions and spending amounts for their expenses, and the software stores them in a list.
2. List Expenses: The program provides a rundown of all recorded expenses, detailing the descriptions and amounts. This gives a quick look at the spending history.
3. User-Friendly Interface: The menu system makes navigation self-explanatory. Users can pick options to add an expense, check out their expenses, or wrap things up.

Example Process:
1. Open Python script.
2. Make choices by typing in the corresponding action (add an expense, see expenses, or report all expenses).
3. When you add an expense, simply add in a description and the amount spent.
4. When the user wants to see their expenses, the program will display a list with each expense numbered.
5. Keep entering or reviewing expenses. 
6. Exit the program.

Potential Features:
- Incorporate date tracking for each expense.
- Include categories to sort expenses (like groceries, entertainment, bills).
- Generate reports and summaries to analyze spending trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
- Implement a way to save expenses for future sessions, maybe using a file or database.

Goal:
This project is a simple starting point for getting a snapshot of the users daily spending. Although it will not have all the capabilities of a professional expense tracking app, it sets the user on the right path to better understanding their daily financial habits.
